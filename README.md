The project successfully demonstrated how data science can be applied in the real estate industry to assist buyers, sellers, and investors in making informed decisions. The implementation of predictive analytics and recommendation systems added significant value to the property search experience.

# Real Estate Data Science Project

## Overview
This project focuses on leveraging data science techniques to provide insights, predictions, and recommendations in the real estate domain. The project covers various stages, including data gathering, cleaning, exploratory analysis, modeling, recommendation systems, and deployment of a user-friendly application.

## Features
- **Data Collection:** Real estate data was self-scraped from the 99acres website and other property listing sources.
- **Data Cleaning & Merging:** Handled missing values, ensured consistency, and combined multiple datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized trends, pricing distributions, and influential factors.
- **Model Building:** Machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Ensemble Models) were used to predict property prices.
- **Web Application:** A Flask-based web app was developed for users to explore properties, view predictions, and receive recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Streamlit)
- **Machine Learning** (Regression Models, Recommendation Systems)
- **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Web Scraping** (BeautifulSoup, Selenium)
